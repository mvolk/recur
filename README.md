# recur
Aggregates recurring transactions into monthly budget numbers.

This simple utility is motivated by my personal budgeting process. I compile a list of
recurring transactions and use that list as the starting point for budgeting. In the
past I have manually transformed my list of recurring expenses into monthly budget
figures. Aside from being rote and error-prone, manual compilation also reduces the
value of my data for modeling purposes. This utility is the answer to those simple
problems.
